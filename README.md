# Azure-Virtual-Machines


### To begin our Azure Honeynet project, we’ll set up virtual machines (VMs) as the foundation. Azure Virtual Machines act like cloud-based computers and will be essential for our honeynet. Here are the steps we’ll follow in Microsoft Azure:


**1 . Sign in to the Azure portal:**


Visit the Azure portal(https://portal.azure.com/).
Log in using your existing Azure account credentials.
If you don’t have an account yet, create one here. With an Azure free account, you’ll get 12 months of free services, access to over 40 services that are always free, and a $200 credit to explore additional services within 30 days. It’s a great way to get started with Azure! 😊🔐🌐
